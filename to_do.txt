Fastapi handles backend

2 routes:
1) /upload
Upload the pdf 
Receives the file upload, pushes a job to redis, returns 200 OK processing in background

Celery worker: PyPdf strip text from pages, chunking, embedding, storage in vectordb
mark sucess in redis, frontend shows ready

2) /chat
user query -> embed -> send to qdrant -> returns top 3 relevant paragraphs -> fastapi creates prompt
sends prompt to ollama container
ollama loads compressed model
ollama streams response -> fastapi -> websocket -> react frontend
